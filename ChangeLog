	* planner-publish.el: Associate finalize function with
	:before-end, rather than :after.  That way, if Planner files are
	included in another file by means of Muse's new <include> tag,
	these transforms will still be applied.

2006-11-29  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* planner-publish.el (planner-publish-note-tag): Don't call
	planner-replace-regexp-in-string if either the text or the regexp
	are empty strings.  This should fix a bug with note publishing
	that XEmacs users were experiencing.  Thanks to Cumhur Erkut for
	the report.

2006-11-04  John Sullivan  <john@wjsullivan.net>

	* planner-el.texi (PSVN): Document all options and dependencies.
	(Hyperlinks): Reference Muse hyperlink syntax.

	* planner.el (planner-search-notes-internal): Provide a full path
	to the search results. Thanks to Michael Randall for reporting the
	bug.
	(planner-search-notes): Adjust display for new results return
	format.

	* planner-mhe.el: Remove unnecessary require. 

2006-10-20  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* planner-calendar.el: Adapt for nested tag support.  Thanks to
	Charles philip Chan for noticing.

2006-10-16  Adrian Aichner  <adrian@xemacs.org>

	* timeclock.el: Typo fixes.
	* timeclock.el (timeclock-history): New.
	* timeclock.el (timeclock-use-history): New.
	* timeclock.el (timeclock-log): Honor timeclock-use-history.
	* timeclock.el (timeclock-read-moment): Provide error on
	unexpected data in timeclock-file, going unnoticed until now.
	* timeclock.el (timeclock-find-discrep): Report line number of
	discrepancy to ease manual fixing.

2006-10-16  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* planner-authz.el (planner-authz-markup-tags): Adapt for nested
	tag support.

	* planner-notes-index.el: Use add-hook instead of add-to-list, in
	case muse-publish has not been loaded yet.  Use
	muse-publish-markup-tags instead of planner-markup-tags.

	* planner-publish.el (planner-publish-markup-tags): Adapt for
	nested tag support.  Make the <nested-section> tag nestable.

	* planner-timeclock.el: Use add-hook instead of add-to-list, in
	case muse-publish has not been loaded yet.  Use
	muse-publish-markup-tags and muse-colors-markup-tags instead of
	planner-markup-tags.
	(planner-colors-timeclock-report-tag)
	(planner-publish-timeclock-report-tag): New functions created from
	planner-timeclock-report-tag.

2006-09-26  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* planner.el (planner-setup-highlighting): Don't quote
	beginning-of-line.  This should fix a bug that was noticed in
	recent Emacs 22 builds.

2006-09-23  John Sullivan  <john@wjsullivan.net>

	* planner-el.texi (Installing from Arch): Fix arch revision
	number.

2006-09-10  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* planner-zoom.el (planner-zoom-iup, planner-zoom-idown)
	(planner-zoom-inext, planner-zoom-iprev): Use planner-page-name
	instead of buffer-name.  This fixes a match-string error, and
	makes things work when you have muse-file-extension set to
	something.

2006-09-04  John Sullivan  <john@wjsullivan.net>

	* planner.el (planner-list-tasks-with-status): Fix doc string.

	timeclock entry had no project name.

2006-08-12  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* Makefile (.PHONY): Split long line.

	* AUTHORS: Bookkeeping.

	* contrib/schedule.el: Update header.

	* contrib/timeclock.el: Install Adrian's changes from 2006-08-01.
	Note that this version of the file is not distributed with GNU
	Emacs, but with Planner instead.

2006-08-11  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* planner-calendar.el (planner-calendar-published-file-href): Fix
	potential error when the calendar for next month is empty.

2006-08-08  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	in the Emacs source tree.

	* ChangeLog.2: Rename from ChangeLog.2005 to comply with standards
	in the Emacs source tree.

2006-08-01  Adrian Aichner  <adrian@xemacs.org>

	* timeclock.el: Keep timeclock-file buffer around, so that an
	encrypted timeclock-file does not have to be opened on each
	clocking operation (requiring entry of encryption key).
	* timeclock.el (timeclock-get-timeclock-file-buffer): New.
	* timeclock.el (timeclock-log): Don't kill timeclock-file buffer.
	* timeclock.el (timeclock-log-data): Use
	`timeclock-get-timeclock-file-buffer', which avoids reading
	timeclock-file, if it's already in a live buffer.
	* timeclock.el (timeclock-find-discrep): Ditto.
	* timeclock.el (timeclock-visit-timelog): Ditto.

See ChangeLog.3 for earlier changes.
