	* planner-el.texi (Installing from Arch): Fix arch revision
	number.

2006-09-10  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* planner-zoom.el (planner-zoom-iup, planner-zoom-idown)
	(planner-zoom-inext, planner-zoom-iprev): Use planner-page-name
	instead of buffer-name.  This fixes a match-string error, and
	makes things work when you have muse-file-extension set to
	something.

2006-09-04  John Sullivan  <john@wjsullivan.net>

	* planner.el (planner-list-tasks-with-status): Fix doc string.

	* planner-el.texi (Publishing Planner pages): Clarify the
	requirements and remove redundancies.
	(Notes): Update and clarify information about remember-planner.

2006-08-22  Magnus Henoch  <mange@freemail.hu>

	messages as read problem.

2006-08-20  John Sullivan  <john@wjsullivan.net>

	* planner-el.texi (Concept Index): Standardize and add missing
	module filenames as index entries.

2006-08-18  Marko Schütz  <schutz_m@usp.ac.fj>

	* planner-timeclock-summary-proj.el
	(planner-timeclock-proj-entries): Fix bug that occurred when a
	timeclock entry had no project name.

2006-08-12  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* Makefile (.PHONY): Split long line.

	* AUTHORS: Bookkeeping.

	* contrib/schedule.el: Update header.

	* contrib/timeclock.el: Install Adrian's changes from 2006-08-01.
	Note that this version of the file is not distributed with GNU
	Emacs, but with Planner instead.

2006-08-11  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* planner-calendar.el (planner-calendar-published-file-href): Fix
	potential error when the calendar for next month is empty.

2006-08-08  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* ChangeLog.1: Rename from ChangeLog.2004 to comply with standards
	in the Emacs source tree.

	* ChangeLog.2: Rename from ChangeLog.2005 to comply with standards
	in the Emacs source tree.

	* ChangeLog.3: New file created from the old ChangeLog.

2006-08-01  Adrian Aichner  <adrian@xemacs.org>

	* timeclock.el: Keep timeclock-file buffer around, so that an
	encrypted timeclock-file does not have to be opened on each
	clocking operation (requiring entry of encryption key).
	* timeclock.el (timeclock-get-timeclock-file-buffer): New.
	* timeclock.el (timeclock-log): Don't kill timeclock-file buffer.
	* timeclock.el (timeclock-log-data): Use
	`timeclock-get-timeclock-file-buffer', which avoids reading
	timeclock-file, if it's already in a live buffer.
	* timeclock.el (timeclock-find-discrep): Ditto.
	* timeclock.el (timeclock-visit-timelog): Ditto.

See ChangeLog.3 for earlier changes.
